Here are codes we used to do the following:
  - Extraxting threads from the zip file
  - Parsing the threads to collect data
  - Extracting adjectives from 900,000 threads
  - Tkinter GUI (old approach)
  
These codes are more complicated, some take a long time to run (~3 hours for adjective extracting), so we do not recommend running these. 
In addition, some results have been manually edited, such as the adjective list. 
Mainly these codes produce the base data used for further analysis, and that data is provided to the user.
